        Before I got into coding, I have 5 years work experience as a pharmacy technician between retail and hospitals. While living abroad in Taiwan, I tutored English as a second language to local Taiwanese. Prior to pharmacy, I had also worked in restaurants and customer service.

        I'm a full-stack web developer currently attending the Ohio State University's coding bootcamp course.
        I enjoy playing video games on my PlayStation 5, spending time with my two cats, trying new online recipes, and taking walks at the nearby park.
